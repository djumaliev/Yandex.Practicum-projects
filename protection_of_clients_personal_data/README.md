Yandex Practicum Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp: Protection of Clients' Personal Data.

Protection of Clients' Personal Data
You need to protect the data of clients of the insurance company "Even Flood." Develop a method of transforming the data so that it is difficult to reconstruct personal information from them. Substantiate the correctness of its operation.

It is necessary to protect the data in such a way that the quality of machine learning models does not deteriorate during transformation. It is not necessary to search for the best model.

Project Execution Order:
Upload and study the data.
Answer the question and justify the solution.
If features are multiplied by an invertible matrix, will the quality of linear regression change? (To check, retrain it.)
a. It will change. Provide examples of matrices.
b. It will not change. Specify how the parameters of linear regression in the original problem and in the transformed one are related.
Propose a data transformation algorithm to solve the problem. Provide justification for why the quality of linear regression will not change.
Program this algorithm, applying matrix operations. Check whether the quality of linear regression from sklearn differs before and after transformation. Apply the R2 metric.

Used lybraries:
pandas, numpy, os, matplotlib, sklearn
