Yandex Practicum Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp: Age Determination of Buyers.

Project Description:
The "Bread-Salt" network supermarket is implementing a computer vision system for processing photographs of customers. Photo fixation in the checkout area will help determine the age of customers in order to:

- Analyze purchases and recommend products that may interest customers of that age group.
- Monitor the integrity of cashiers when selling alcohol.

We will build a model that, based on a photograph, approximates the age of a person. We have a set of photos of people with their specified ages at our disposal.

Project Execution:

1. Conduct an exploratory analysis of the photo dataset.
2. Prepare the data for training.
3. Train the neural network and evaluate its quality.

Used lybraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, tensorflow
